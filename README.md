# content-blocker-lib-ios

An older stand-alone content blocking component lib from Firefox iOS.
Better to use https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/tree/master/content-blocker-lib-ios
Which is largely stand-alone but in the Firefox iOS codebase.
Ping me or file an issue if you need this project updated.
